                          <p>Hi! I am Anna. An active IT Professional progressing my career to its next stage: becoming a full stack developer. Why so specific? Well... the term developer is too broad and narrow at the same time. As I'm interested in working with front end (interface design) and back end (Data Bases etc.) the normal terminology seems not adequate to express myself. Especially, since I have huge active interested in Computer Vision and related to that topics, such as movement recognition, parallelization etc.</p>
                          <p>Given everything I'm interested in I created this website to showcase my experience (resume, projects, publications) and share my thoughts (blog and comments to other sections). It is much easier to just have everything in one place instead of showing bits and pieces though different social media accounts or sites. It is my hope that this will work out better than my previous attempts with YouTube channel, blogs (including WordPress) and just storing things on dropbox to share.</p>
                          <p>Unfortunately, the site is still under construction (I cannot seem to decide which projects I should add to it and what to write about them). Over half of the site is filled with babble just to add some volume to it. The reason behind? It is a project for one of my Masters course classes. I love practical and useful projects like that!</p>
                          <p>If you have any questions, especially about missing content, please ask. I'll try to answer as soon as I can. Have a lovely afternoon!</p>
