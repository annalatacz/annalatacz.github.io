                <section>
                    <h2>Technologies used:</h2>
                    <article>
                        <h3>HTML</h3>
                        <p>The site had been written in html 5 as per requirements. The elements had been chosen on a fit-for-purpose basis and are self explanatory (based on the names of the sections used in the main navigation bar).</p>
                    </article><article>
                        <h3>CSS</h3>
                        <p>The site uses CSS. All files are located in the css folder. There is one general file for style of the website. Given research on websites available in the internet I was not sure what exactly classifies as non-trivial use of CSS so I used it for several things:</p>
						<ul>
                            <li>General styling of the website (fonts, indents etc.).</li>
                            <li>Ensuring website is mobile and small screen friendly and responsive.</li>
							<li>Provide printing format (with exclusion of unnecessary elements like menu).</li>
							<li>Background creation - My version is a night sky with stars. It required creative use of the gradient background and box-shadow attribute. As only CSS was mentioned I focused on the static generation of stars (instead of using SCSS etc.). 
							Originally I was thinking about enhancing sky with the animation of the stars and/or gradient but during testing a few people mentioned that they got a bit "sea sick" so I dropped the idea.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2>Additional requirements:</h2>
                    <article>
                        <h3>Browser compatibility</h3>
                        <p>The site had been tested on web browsers:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mozilla Firefox 66.0.1</li>
                            <li>Chrome 73.0.3683.86</li>
                            <li>Samsung internet 8.2.01.2 (Mobile browser on Samsung Galaxy S6</li>
                        </ul>
                    </article>
                    <article>
                        <h3>Disabled compatibility</h3>
                        <p>Site had been designed taking into consideration possible disabled users. Some of the things that were taken into account:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>High contrasting colours for links and text (used https://contrastchecker.com/) and all foreground/background ratios are over 11 (which is way bigger contrast than recommened 4.5:1 ratio).</li>
                            <li>Non-colour indications of the possition on the site using cursor, or changes made to the button or link when user hovers or clicks on them.</li>
                            <li>Appropriate use of sections and articles (including headers) for ease of use screen readers.</li>
                            <li>Skip link for the menu.</li>
                            <li>Header of each page indicating where the user is.</li>
                            <li>Big fonts and easy to read spacing (no justify that would change it and confuse reading software).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Site had been tested using WAVE web accessibility evaluation tool.</p>
                    </article>
                    <article>
                        <h3>Project Description Page</h3>
                        <p>This page is describing the technologies used along with the tests that had been performed on the site to confirm that it is working up to specified standards.</p>
                    </article>
                    <article>
                        <h3>MENU</h3>
                        <p>
                            Menu is in the form of a navigation bar at the top of the website. As I was not sure concerning how complex menu should be (the project specification was not clear on that point) I decided to create enought pages to demonstrate a 2 level solution: 
							main menu on top of the pages and 2 sub-pages used for listing of projects and publications that are used as sub-menus for those specific sections. For this website there was no need to create anything more complicated as it would have made the site unreadable.
                        </p>
                    </article>
                    <article>
                        <h3>Readability</h3>
                        <p>The readability of the page is good. There is no non-readable content, too small or too big elements, poor contrast between elements etc.</p>
                    </article>

					<h3>Additional information</h3>
                        <p>I am going to use this website as my personal portfoglio as a developer thus I needed the contact form to work. As this is a static page (and I did not want to set up my own sftp service/server) I used https://formspree.io/. 
						It is a free service that forwards whatever is in the form to specified email address.</p>
