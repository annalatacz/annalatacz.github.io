                    <h2>Technologies used:</h2>
                    <article>
                        <h3>HTML</h3>
                        <p>The site had been written in html 5 as per requirements. The elements had been chosen on a fit-for-purpose basis and are self-explanatory (based on the names of the sections used in the main navigation bar).</p>
                    </article><article>
                        <h3>CSS</h3>
                        <p>The site uses CSS. All files are located in the CSS folder. There is one general file for style of the website. Given research on websites available on the internet I was not sure what exactly classifies as non-trivial use of CSS, so I used it for several things:</p>
						<ul>
                            <li>General styling of the website (fonts, indents etc.). </li>
                            <li>Ensuring website is mobile and small screen friendly and responsive.</li>
							<li>Provide printing format (with exclusion of unnecessary elements like menu).</li>
							<li>Background creation - My version is a night sky with stars. It required creative use of the gradient background and box-shadow attribute. Only CSS was mentioned thus I focused on the static generation of stars (instead of using SCSS etc.). 
							Originally I was thinking about enhancing sky with the animation of the stars and/or gradient but during testing a few people mentioned that they got a bit “sea sick” so I dropped the idea.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </article><article>
                        <h3>Cookies with JavaScript</h3>
                        <p>For the third technology used I choose cookies. The cookie is incorporated into this specific sub-page/section of the website as it is required only for the purpose of the assignment. I see no reason to store any information about visitors, and there is nothing here that would 
						require storing of the information for ease of use (e.g. login details, shopping cart), as soon as the assignment is done it will be removed.</p>
						<p>Currently, to illustrate that the cookie created is working as it should it was set up to expire within 3 minutes. Originally, the idea behind it was that the new visitors are greeted when coming to the site with a more personalised greeting but this may seem creepy so it is
						limited only to this page. The banner is visible only to new users (as long as there is no active cookie and there cookies are enabled).</p>

                        <h3>Browser compatibility</h3>
                        <p>The site had been tested on web browsers:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mozilla Firefox 66.0.1</li>
                            <li>Chrome 73.0.3683.86</li>
                            <li>Samsung internet 8.2.01.2 (Mobile browser on Samsung Galaxy S6</li>
                        </ul>
                    </article>
                    <article>
                        <h3>Disabled compatibility</h3>
                        <p>Site had been designed taking into consideration possible disabled users. Things that were taken into account:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>High contrasting colours for links and text (used https://contrastchecker.com/) and all foreground/background ratios are over 11 (which is way bigger contrast than recommend 4.5:1 ratio).</li>
                            <li>Non-colour indications of the position on the site using cursor, or changes made to the button or link when user hovers or clicks on them.</li>
                            <li>Appropriate use of sections and articles (including headers) for ease of use screen readers.</li>
                            <li>Skip links for the menu.</li>
                            <li>Header of each page indicating where the user is.</li>
                            <li>Big fonts and easy to read spacing (no justify that would change it and confuse reading software).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Site had been tested using WAVE web accessibility evaluation tool.</p>
                    </article>
                    <article>
                        <h3>Project Description Page</h3>
                        <p>This page is describing the technologies used along with the tests that had been performed on the site to confirm that it is working up to specified standards.</p>
                    </article>
                    <article>
                        <h3>MENU</h3>
                        <p>
                            Menu is in the form of a navigation bar at the top of the website. As I was not sure concerning how complex menu should be (the project specification was not clear on that point) I decided to create enough pages to demonstrate a 2 level solution: main menu on top of the pages and 2 sub-pages used for
							listing of projects and publications that are used as sub-menus for those specific sections. For this website there was no need to create anything more complicated as it would have made the site unreadable.
                        </p>

                    <article>
                        <h3>Readability</h3>
                        <p>The readability of the page is good. There is no non-readable content, too small or too big elements, poor contrast between elements etc.</p>
                    </article>

					<h3>Additional information</h3>
                        <p>I am going to use this website as my personal portfolio as a developer thus I needed the contact form to work. As this is a static page (and I did not want to set up my own mail service/server) I used https://formspree.io/. It is a free service that forwards whatever is in the form to specified email address.</p>
