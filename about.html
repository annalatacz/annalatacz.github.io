                        <h3>HTML</h3>
                        <p>The site had been written in html 5 as per requirements. The elements had been chosen on a fit-for-purpose basis and are self explanatory (based on the names of the sections used in the main navigation bar).</p>
                    </article><article>
                        <h3>CSS</h3>
                        <p>The site uses CSS. All files are located in the css folder. There is one general file for style of the website and specifc files for other elements that are located on the subpages e.g. contact form has its own style.</p>
                        <p>The not-trivial use of CSS is illustrated by: (PROVIDE EXAMPLE FROM THE PROJECT).</p>

                    <article>
                        <h3>Browser compatibility</h3>
                        <p>The site had been tested on web browsers:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mozilla Firefox 66.0.1</li>
                            <li>Chrome 73.0.3683.86</li>
                            <li>Samsung internet 8.2.01.2 (Mobile browser on Samsung Galaxy S6</li>
                        </ul>

                    <article>
                        <h3>Disabled compatibility</h3>
                        <p>Site had been designed taking into consideration possible disabled users. Some of the things that were taken into account:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>high contrasting colours for links and text</li>
                                <li>non-colour indications of the possition on the site: active links are underlined with dotted line, links over which the user is hoovering are underlined with 1 line</li>
                                <li>appropriate use of sections and articles (including headers) for easier readability</li>
                                <li>skip link for the menu</li>
                                <li>header of each page indicating where the user is</li>
                                <li>big fonts and easy to read spacing (no justify that would change it and confuse reading software)</li>
                            </ul>
                        <p>Site had been tested using WAVE web accessibility evaluation tool with success.</p>
                    </article>
                    <article>
                        <h3>Project Description Page</h3>
                        <p>This page is describing the technologies used along with the tests that had been performed on the site to confirm that it is working up to specified standards.</p>
                    </article>
                    <article>
                        <h3>MENU</h3>
                        <p>
                            Menu is in the form of a navigation bar at the top of the website. As I was not sure concerning how complex menu should be (the project specification was not clear on that point) I decided to create enought pages to demonstrate a 2 level solution.
                            For this website there was no need to create anything more complicated as it would have made the site unreadable.
                        </p>

                    <article>
                        <h3>Readability</h3>
                        <p>The readability of the page is good. There is no non-readable content, too small or too big elements, poor contrast between elements etc.</p>
